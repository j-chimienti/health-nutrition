### Antifragile - Nassim Nicholas Taleb

> When	you	starve	yourself	of	food,	it	is	the	bad	proteins	that	are
broken	down	first	and	recycled	by	your	own	body	-	a	process
called	autophagy
	
> Medical	error	still	currently	kills	between	3	times	(as	accepted	by
doctors)	and	ten	times	as	many	people	as	car	accidents	in	the
United	States.	It	is	generally	accepted	that	harm	from	doctors	-
not	including	risks	form	hospital	germs	-	accounts	for	more
deaths	than	any	single	cancer.

> Lifting	weights	increases	your	muscle	mass.	In	the	past	they	used
to	say	that	weight	lifting	caused	the	"micro-tearing	of	muscles,"
with	subsequent	healing	and	increase	in	size.	Today	some	people
discuss	hormonal	signaling	or	genetic	mechanisms,	tomorrow	they
weill	discuss	something	else.	But	the	effect	has	held	forever	and
will	continue	to	do	so.

> Theories	come	and	go;	experience	stays

> Drink	no	liquid	that	is	not	at	least	a	thousand	years	old	-	so	its
fitness	has	been
