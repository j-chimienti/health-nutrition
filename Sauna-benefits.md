## Hyperthermic Conditioning for Hypertrophy, Endurance, and Neurogenesis

1. Improved Endurance
1. increase growth of brain cells
1. Improve insulin sensitivity
1. improve learning and memory
1. Associated with longevity

1. Increase capacity for endurance
    * skin -> improves thermoregulatory control and reducing core temperature during workload
    * muscles -> increases nutrients to muscles and spares local glycogen stores
    * Heart -> Improves cardiovascular mechanisms and reducing heart rate
1. Increase capacity to build muscle
1. Affect brain function and chemistry

### Real world Endurance Gains from Hyperthermic Conditioning

6 distance runners 30 min sauna 2x week after run

**Result**

1. 32% increase in distance they could run before reaching exhaustion
1. 3.5% increase red blood cell count

 ### Hyperthermic Conditioning Increases Hypertrophy

 1. Inducing production of heat shock proteins
   - repair damaged proteins, increase protein synthesis (hypertrophy)
 1. Boosting growth hormone levels
 1. improving insulin sensitivity
 
 ### Real World Hypertrophy from Hyperthermic conditioning
 
 Rats immobilized for 7 days had 30% more muscle regrowth if 
 they are heat stressed during reloading

2 isolated back to back 20 min sessions at 80 cel boosts GH 2x
2 1 hr sessions per day at 80cel for a week causes 16 fold (1600%)

15% increase lifespan in flies and worms

increase in proteins associated with stress tolerance

### Neuroendocrine Effects of heat stress

Increase norepinephrine 3-fold and prolactin 10-fold
and increase capacity to store norepinephrine

norepinephrine focus attention

### Heat Stress and Neurogenesis

- Increase growth of new brain cells
- increase survival of existing brain cells
- improve learning and retention
- reduce depression and anxiety 
- improve muscle repair

50% less likely to die from cardiovascular disease ppl
 4 - 7 times a week v 1x a week
 
 **Characteristics of exercise**
 
 1. 150 bpm
