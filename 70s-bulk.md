# The 70s BULK Program

This is simple as it get, this program prioritizes squats, 
deadlifts, rows, presses, and chins/pullups. 
You do these compound movements, and then you do some DB a
nd bodyweight movements afterwards for further building

There are no machines, no cables, no complicated rep schemes.

You are only training 4 days a week, but the workouts are pretty brutal. Y

you will be tired, you will be sore

expect to be in the gym for a solid hour. Each workout is 25 total sets

You do 5 sets for every exercise. You can do the same weight all sets, you can pyramid the weight up, you can do reverse pyramids and start with low reps then do higher reps
This is up to you

### Program Diet

-Eat 3 meals a day
-Eat your bodyweight x 16 in calories on training days, 12x on non training days

For the compound movements, your working weights are going to the in the 65-80% range of your 1RM. This is the proverbial sweet spot for strength and size gains

You must AUTOREGULATE your training. That means you decide how hard and heavy to go each day based upon how you FEEL. 
-You do not need to take sets to failure on this program, I would suggest no to in fact. Always leave a rep or two “in the tank”
