As you age, the most crucial health measures 
you must maintain are oxygen capacity and lean body mass

The less muscle you have, the faster your body will
age. Muscle is how you defy the force of gravity.
Less muslce you have, the weaker the body is, and faster
it breaks down

Your body is evolved to move, train to move

Fundemental movement patterns:

1. Squatting
1. Lunging
1. Hinging (deadlift)
1. Pulling
1. Pressing

Training should always include bodyweight movements

Eliminate non-purposeful traning, and training should
facilitate you moving better in life

Never train though acute pain, ache, stiffness and soreness is
expected at times. Never ignore sharp, well defined pain

Perform movements in as joint friendly masser as possible

Learn to breath when lifting

Longer warmups are better than short warmups

Train to failure to sets w/ 10+ reps
for reps < 10, leave 1 - 2 in the tank

In order of Most Joint Stress to Least joint stress

-Barbells
-Dumbells and Kettlebells
-Cables and Machines
-Bodyweight, Bands

Do not do heaviest movement first (sve for end or second to end)

Rotate all exercises (weekly or monthly)

Best form of cardio is walking

Never underestimate the power of walking 
30 minutes daily for health and vitality.

Every 3-4 months, consider taking a week long break from heavy training. Do yoga, do some bodyweight exercises and not much else, 
walk a lot, sleep a lot, allow your body a chance to fully and completely recover
