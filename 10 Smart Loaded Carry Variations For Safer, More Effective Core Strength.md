## Author: [drjohnrusin](https://drjohnrusin.com/loaded-carries/)

Loaded carries, no matter what variation you choose, challenges the core more than any crunch or direct core training exercise ever could, but also provides a test for grip strength and full body stability

Ensure that you are matching your loads, duration of carry and rest periods to your goals. Here are three basic programming setups for power, strength and strength-endurance:

## Power
* Load: Maximal
* Work Duration: 10-15 seconds
* Rest Duration: 45-60 seconds
* Sets: 2-4

## Strength

* Load: Heavy
* Work Duration: 20-45 seconds
* Rest Duration: 30-45 seconds
* Sets: 3-5

## Strength-Endurance

* Load: Moderate
* Work Duration: 45-75 seconds
* Rest Duration: 30-45 seconds
* Sets: 3-5
